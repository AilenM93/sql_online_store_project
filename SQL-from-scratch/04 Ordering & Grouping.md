# ORDER BY and GROUP BY clauses in SQL

## ORDER BY

### Description

The `ORDER BY` clause is used to sort the results of a SQL query in a specific order, either ascending (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`).


### Importance

Ordering data is crucial for analysis, as it makes it easier to identify patterns and trends. It is also useful for presenting data in reports and applications.


### Uses

- **Ascending Order:** This is the default order and the `ASC` keyword can be omitted.
- **Descending Order:** Specified with the `DESC` keyword.


### Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column1 [ASC|DESC], column2 [ASC|DESC], ...;
```

## GROUP BY

### Description

The GROUP BY clause is used to group rows that have the same values ​​in specified columns into groups. It is often used in conjunction with aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX) to perform calculations on each group.


### Importance

Grouping data is essential for aggregate analysis, allowing you to summarize large data sets and obtain meaningful statistics.

### Uses

- Group data to get summaries and statistics by category.


### Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, AGGREGATE_FUNCTION(column2)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column1, column2, ...;
```


## Additional considerations

- They are often used together to sort grouped results.

```sql
SELECT Country, COUNT(*) AS NumberOfCustomers
FROM Customers
GROUP BY Country
ORDER BY NumberOfCustomers DESC;
```

- All columns in the SELECT clause must be included in the GROUP BY clause or used within an aggregate function.
